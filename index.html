        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p><strong>Hello Everyone! Welcome to my very first webpage.</strong> 
            My name is Bryan Garcia, a Los Angeles California native currently living in Anaheim. 
            Just 10 minutes away from Disneyland, so yes, I'm practically one of the happiest people on Earth 
            <em>(well, when I'm not stuck in traffic).</em> 
            My friends and family describe me as quiet, introverted, funny, witty and friendly. 
            Although I do enjoy my solitude, I do also enjoy to work with and help others. 
            Think of me like a good software update, quietly working in the background, but when I'm around things are always a little better. 
            I live at home with my beautiful wife and our three golden retrievers. 
            I guess you could say I'm a parent to three furry children, who never ask for a car, cell phone or a college tuition. 
            But they surely make up for it with vet bills. 
            I'm currently in the process of making a career change from a supervisor at UPS to a software developer. 
            So instead of tracking down packages, I'll be tracking down bugs, and hopefully delivering some smooth running code. 
            As I navigate through this new chapter in my career, I look forward to the new opportunities, friends and experiences that lie ahead.
        </p>
        <h2>My Hobbies</h2>
        <p class="p_important">My hobbies include building Legos, solving puzzles, playing video games and binge watching television. 
            When I'm not glued to a TV screen, I'm usually doom scrolling through TikTok on my phone. 
        </p>      
        <h2>My Goals</h2>
        <p id="p1">My current goal is to transition into a career as a software developer, where I can put my love for problem solving to good use. 
            I'm also working towards returning to school and earning my bachelors degree in computer science. 
            Ultimately, I'm excited to grow in the tech field and build a future, one line of code at a time!
